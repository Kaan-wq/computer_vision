# **Computer Vision**

This repository is designed to share my journey of explorating the computer vision landscape.

## **Repository Structure**

### **`diffusion_models`**
This directory contains core implementations and utilities for diffusion models:

- `ddpm.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook detailing the training pipeline of the DDPM model on the MNIST dataset.
- `ddpm.py`: Python script with the full implementation of the DDPM suitable for training and evaluating on datasets.

### **`resnet_models`**
This directory contains basic implementations of a few ResNet architectures for image classification and trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

- `resnet.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook detailing the training pipeline of the ResNet model on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- `resnet.py`: Python script with the full implementation of the ResNet models suitable for training and evaluating on datasets.
